# Yelp API Swift Project

Welcome to my Swift project that leverages the Yelp API to help users explore local businesses! This app provides a seamless user experience with a tabbed onboarding, location permissions, and dynamic views for browsing and exploring businesses.

## üöÄ Features

### Onboarding Experience
The application starts by greeting the user with a **brief tabbed onboarding**, introducing the app's function and capabilities.

### Location Permissions
To function properly, the app asks the user to **grant location permissions** to find nearby businesses.

### Detailed Business View
Once a business is selected, the app presents a **detail view** with dynamic images and links. These links allow the user to open the business in Safari or call directly via the phone app.
